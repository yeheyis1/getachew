## Folder structure

In the root folder there are 4 folders:
- **pages** *The NextJS & GatsbyJS pre-rendered pages are located under this folder. If you are not using NextJS or GatsbyJS you may delete or ignore the `pages` folder*
- **plugins** *The GatsbyJS custom plugins are located under this folder. If you are not using GatsbyJS you may delete or ignore the `plugins` folder*
- **public** *Here are the public assets, images and `index.html` file. Note that you don't need `index.html` file if you are using NextJS or GatsbyJS versions. Also note, that when running GatsbyJS build scripts the `index.html` file will be overwritten. If you want to recover the file copy the content of `_index.html` and past into `index.html`*
- **src** *Here is the main business logic of the theme.*
- **|----assets**
- **|----common**
- **|----components** *The reusable and stand-alone components are stored here, by following [Atomic Design Methodology](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)*
- **|----|----atoms** *These are small functional components that are not using any other atomic components*
- **|----|----molecules** *Tese are those functional components which have dependencies from other atoms*
- **|----|----organisms** *These are the functional components that are using other molecules and atoms*
- **|----layouts**
- **|----|----Main** *The main layout: header navigation, the main container and footer part*
- **|----|----Minimal** *The minimal layout*
- **|----theme** *In this folder there are overrides of the default color palette and typography coming from MUI*
- **|----views** *All the views/pages that are available. Here are the combination and composition of re-usable components and pages representations.*
- **|----App.js** *This is the main starting point file, which instantiates React router and renders the application views. If you are not using react-scripts you may delete or ignore the `App.js` file*
- **|----serviceWorker.js** *React Scripts specific file. If you are not using react-scripts you may delete or ignore the `serviceWorker.js` file*

## Quick start with React Scripts

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Start the server: `npm run cra:start`
- Build on production: `npm run cra:build`

## Quick start with Pre-rendered version NextJS Scripts

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Start the server: `npm run dev`
- Build on production: `npm run build`

## Quick start with Pre-rendered version GatsbyJS Scripts

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Start the server: `npm run gb:develop`
- Build on production: `npm run gb:build`
- Built files are in `dist` folder

## Instalation of images

In order to not overload the theme size with the static images we hosted them into a different git repository and put them as a dependency of the theme which is being installed when doing `npm i` and being copied from `node_modules` into the `public/assets/images` folder during `npm postinstall`
The images will be deleted from `public/assets/images` folder and will be fetched again from remote git repository every time you do `npm i`

*First you need to do the following, before starting to modify/customize the theme and also images based on your app/business needs:*

- Download images manually from https://github.com/gevorgmakaryan/thefront-assets
- Copy the `images` folder and paste into the `public/assets` folder
- Remove the `public/assets/images` in `.gitignore` file
- Open the `package.json` file and remove `assets` and `postinstall` scripts
- Remove `thefront-assets` from the `dependencies` in `package.json` file
